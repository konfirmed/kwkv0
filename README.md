# KWK

This was meant to be a closed repo, opening it up to folks who are interested in building a Web Performance tool that helps debug and recommend solutions to Web Performance issues

## Content
- CrUX metrics
- Lighthouse metrics
- Head Tag debugger (WIP)
- Event Timing API (works on your device, and not the vercel link atm)
- Layout Shift Debugger

## Coming Soon
- a debugger/recommender on how to improve LCP
- fix for the Event Timing API piece
